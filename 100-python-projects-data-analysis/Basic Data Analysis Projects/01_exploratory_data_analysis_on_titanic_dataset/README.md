## Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset
## Objective
The objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights regarding passenger survival based on various attributes.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographics, ticket class, cabin, fare, and survival status.

## Methodology
Data Loading: Load the Titanic dataset using Python's pandas library.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and perform necessary data transformations.
Descriptive Statistics: Compute descriptive statistics to understand the dataset.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations (e.g., histograms, bar charts, heatmaps) to explore relationships and distributions within the data.

## Installation
To run the code for this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Usage

cd titanic-eda
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Titanic_EDA.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each cell and observe the results.

## Results
The exploratory data analysis reveals insights such as:

## Distribution of passenger demographics.
Survival rates based on different factors like ticket class, age, and gender.
Correlations between variables and survival probability.
