## Objective
The Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster Competition is the most known problem that beginners attempt to solve in both Machine Learning and Data Science. This competition wants the participants to predict whether a passanger survived the ship wreck. In order to make these predictions, we are provided with both training and testing datasets for which we will appy data exploration and preprocessing techniques in order to reach our end goal.

## Dataset
survival - Indicates if the passenger survived the ship wreck, it is our target variable (the variable we will be predicting).
pclass - Indicates the socio-economic status of the given passanger (1st = Upper, 2nd = Middle, 3rd = Lower).
sex - Male or Female.
Age - The age of the passenger.
sibsp - The number of siblings / spouses of the passanger that are on-board.
parch - The number of parents / children that are on-board.
ticket - Ticket number, which is the unique identifier of each passanger.
fare - How much the passanger has paid in total.
cabin - The cabin number of the passanger.
Embarked - Which port the passanger embarked from (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Methodology
Data Loading: Load the Titanic dataset using Python's pandas library.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and perform necessary data transformations.
Descriptive Statistics: Compute descriptive statistics to understand the dataset.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations (e.g., histograms, bar charts, heatmaps) to explore relationships and distributions within the data.

## Installation
To run the code for this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/titanic-eda.git
cd titanic-eda
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Titanic_EDA.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each cell and observe the results.

## Results
The exploratory data analysis reveals insights such as:

## Distribution of passenger demographics.
Survival rates based on different factors like ticket class, age, and gender.
Correlations between variables and survival probability.
